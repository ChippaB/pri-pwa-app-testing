You are an expert full-stack developer tasked with upgrading a production barcode logging PWA (Progressive Web App) to a cutting-edge, corporate-grade interface while preserving all existing functionality. The current system is a lightweight, offline-capable scanner that logs to Google Sheets via Apps Script, with duplicate rejection, queueing, and live feedback. Your goal is to reverse-engineer and enhance the entire codebase into a polished, branded, enterprise-ready solution.

PROJECT CONTEXT (Provided Files)
System Overview

Frontend: PWA hosted on Cloudflare Pages (index.html, app.js, manifest.json, service-worker.js)
Backend: Google Apps Script Web App (doPost endpoint) → appends to _RAW_DATA sheet
Data Flow: Barcode scanner → keyboard input → PWA parses → POST JSON → Apps Script → Google Sheet
Key Features:
Offline queue + auto-sync
Duplicate detection by serial
Operator + station persistence
Real-time status (OK / DUPLICATE / OFFLINE)
Zero onEdit() triggers


Current Files (Exact Content Attached)

index.html – Minimal dark UI with input fields, status bar
app.js – Core logic: parsing, sending, queueing, UI updates
manifest.json – PWA metadata (no icons yet)
service-worker.js – Caches assets for offline use
current google apps script.txt – Backend with CORS, secret, deduplication
Client Logo: polytechnic logo 678 x 297.png
→ Use the exact logo in header and favicon. White version on dark background.


UPGRADE DIRECTIVES (Next-Level Enhancements)
Transform this into a professional, corporate, cutting-edge interface with zero bloat.
1. Visual & Brand Overhaul

Integrate Client Logo:
Replace <h1>SeeScan</h1> with logo + "Serial Number Scan Log" text
Add logo as 48px favicon (generate ICO/PNG)
Use logo in PWA install prompt

Color Scheme:
Primary: #0b0f14 (deep navy) – keep
Accent: #2563eb → upgrade to Polytechnic Blue (#1E40AF) or extract from logo
Success: #10b981, Warning: #f59e0b, Error: #ef4444

Typography:
Use Inter (Google Fonts) – already in CSS, ensure loaded
Hierarchy: font-weight: 600 for labels, 700 for status


2. UI/UX Modernization

Glassmorphism Cards:cssbackdrop-filter: blur(12px);
background: rgba(17, 24, 38, 0.75);
border: 1px solid rgba(31, 42, 55, 0.5);
Micro-interactions:
Pulse animation on successful scan
Subtle scale on button press
Smooth status fade-in/out

Scan Field:
Auto-focus + blinking cursor
Visual scanner beam effect on focus
Clear button (×) when text present

Last Scan Preview:
Show part + serial in two lines
Copy-to-clipboard on click

Queue Indicator:
Progress circle or badge with count
Tap to view queued items (modal)


3. PWA Polish

Update manifest.json:json"icons": [
  {"src": "icon-192.png", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/png"},
  {"src": "icon-512.png", "sizes": "512x512", "type": "image/png"}
]→ Generate icons from logo (white on transparent, rounded)
Add display: standalone + splash screens
Enable install prompt after first scan

4. Enhanced Feedback System

Status Bar:
Icon + text: ✓ OK, ⚠ DUPLICATE, ↻ QUEUED
Auto-hide after 2.5s

Sound Cues (optional, toggleable):
Success beep (short), duplicate (double), error (low)


5. New Features (Non-Breaking)

FeatureImplementationScan History (Last 5)  LocalStorage ring buffer → collapsible panel
Auto-clear Raw Input  After successful send
Kiosk Mode Ready  Fullscreen API on load (optional)
Dark/Light Toggle  Respect system preference + manual switch
Configurable Stations  Load from URL param or localStorage JSON

6. Code Quality & Structure

Split app.js into modules (if using bundler) or IIFE sections
Add JSDoc comments
Use async/await consistently
Error boundary for fetch/parse
Input sanitization (already good)


OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
Generate complete, ready-to-deploy files:

index.html – Updated with logo, modern layout
app.js – Enhanced logic + new features
manifest.json – With icons array
service-worker.js – Updated cache name (seescan-v2)
